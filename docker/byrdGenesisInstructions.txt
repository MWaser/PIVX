********Genesis Block Creation Documentation

********We are interested in step 7 of this:
********https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=225690.0

********I didn't make it much farther since I decided to run through the steps again and make sure they worked.

********Step 1: Create the docker container

********copy the files I sent into an empty folder.
********navigate to the directory on shell utility of choice.

docker build -t pbuilder ./
docker run -it pbuilder bash
git clone -b "master" --depth 1 "https://cbyrdsw:Justic3123@agii.visualstudio.com/_git/DiviProject" /shared/pivx

cd pivx
********Note that any time you change the core code this must be run again.  But it doesn't take very long after first run.
./autogen.sh
./configure --without-gui --enable-debug
make
sudo make install
********End of build.
cd /home/ubuntu

********here I dropped in a pivx.conf file from
********https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/master/contrib/debian/examples/pivx.conf.
********Haven't added a wget for this into the Dockerfile yet.

********uncomment line for rpcuser and rpcpassword.
********Not sure how to cleanly stop and reinstall the daemon.  Once you start, open the debug file quickly, it fills up fast.
pivxd -debug
********Here my powershell locked up.  So I execed back into another shell using 
docker exec -it yourcontainerhere bash
cd /home/ubuntu/.pivx 
********and you should see the config.log file!
vi config.log

Next step should be to find and place the hashes from the config.log file into the correct places in chainparams.cpp.
Then uncomment the asserts and cross your fingers.
